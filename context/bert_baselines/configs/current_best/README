1. symlink the config files of the best performing models into this directory, making sure to name the links something sensible.
   Also make sure you're linking the logged config file that contains the version number in its path.
   E.g., ln -s /mnt/iusers01/nactem01/u14498jv/scratch/n2c2_track1/context/bert_baseline_logs/clinical_bert/certainty_entity_marked/version_3/config.yaml certainty.yaml

2. Run create_split_configs.sh. This will copy and modify the config files above to run over the CV splits, saving them to cv_split_configs/

3. Run run_train_val_splits.sh. This will run training, prediction, and validation using each of the config files above. The models and predictions are saved under the version directory in the symlink from step 1.
   E.g. /mnt/iusers01/nactem01/u14498jv/scratch/n2c2_track1/context/bert_baseline_logs/clinical_bert/certainty_entity_marked/version_3/cv_splits/

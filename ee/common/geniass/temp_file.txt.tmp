Radiation retinopathy is treatable with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor bevacizumab (Avastin).
PURPOSE: To report on bevacizumab treatment for radiation retinopathy affecting the macula.__0____ __PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with radiation retinopathy (edema, hemorrhages, capillary dropout, and neovascularization)__1____ __and a subjective or objective loss of vision were treated.__2____ __Treatment involved intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg in 0.05 mL)__3____ __every 6-12 weeks.__4____ __Treatment was discontinued at patient request or if there was no measurable response to therapy.__5____ __Main outcome measures included best corrected visual acuity, ophthalmic examination, retinal photography, and angiography.__6____ __RESULTS: Bevacizumab treatment was followed by reductions in retinal hemorrhage, exudation, and edema.__7____ __Visual acuities were stable or improved in 86% (n=18).__8____ __Three patients discontinued therapy.__9____ __Each was legally blind before treatment (n=1), experienced little to no subjective improvement (n=2), or was poorly compliant (n=2).__10____ __Three patients (14%)__11____ __regained 2 or more lines of visual acuity.__12____ __No ocular or systemic bevacizumab-related side effects were observed.__13____ __CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal bevacizumab can be used to treat radiation retinopathy.__14____ __In most cases treatment was associated with decreased vascular leakage, stabilization, or improved vision.__15____ __An anti-vascular endothelial growth factor strategy may reduce tissue damage associated with radiation vasculopathy and neuropathy.

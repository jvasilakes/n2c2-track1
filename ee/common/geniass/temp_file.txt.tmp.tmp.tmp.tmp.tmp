Gene transfer of naked DNA encoding for three isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor stimulates collateral development in vivo.
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)__0____ __is a naturally secreted endothelial cell-specific mitogen.__1____ __We investigated the hypothesis that naked DNA encoding for VEGF could be used in a strategy of arterial gene therapy to stimulate collateral artery development.__2____ __Plasmid DNA encoding each of the three principal human VEGF isoforms (phVEGF121, phVEGF165, or phVEGF189)__3____ __was applied to the hydrogel polymer coating of an angioplasty balloon and delivered percutaneously to one iliac artery of rabbits with operatively induced hindlimb ischemia.__4____ __Compared with control animals transfected with LacZ, site-specific transfection of phVEGF resulted in augmented collateral vessel development documented by serial angiography, and improvement in calf blood pressure ratio (ischemic to normal limb), resting and maximum blood flow, and capillary to myocyte ratio.__5____ __Similar results were obtained with phVEGF121, phVEGF165, and phVEGF189, which suggests that these isoforms are biologically equivalent with respect to in vivo angiogenesis.__6____ __The fact that viral or other adjunctive vectors were not required further suggests that secreted gene products may have potential therapeutic utility even when the number of successfully transfected cells remains low.__7____ __Arterial gene transfer of naked DNA encoding for a secreted angiogenic cytokine, thus, represents a potential alternative to recombinant protein administration for stimulating collateral vessel development.

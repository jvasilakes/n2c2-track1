Angiogenesis associated with visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue in severe human obesity.
OBJECTIVE: The expansion of adipose tissue is linked to the development of its vasculature.__0____ __However, the regulation of adipose tissue angiogenesis in humans has not been extensively studied.__1____ __Our aim was to compare the angiogenesis associated with subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT)__2____ __and visceral adipose tissue (VAT)__3____ __from the same obese patients in an in vivo model.__4____ __RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adipose tissue samples from visceral (VAT)__5____ __and subcutaneous (SAT)__6____ __sites, obtained from 36 obese patients (mean BMI 46.5 kg/m(2))__7____ __during bariatric surgery, were layered on chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM).__8____ __RESULTS: Both SAT and VAT expressed angiogenic factors without significant difference for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)__9____ __expression.__10____ __Adipose tissue layered on CAM stimulated angiogenesis.__11____ __Angiogenic stimulation was macroscopically detectable, with engulfment of the samples, in 39% and was evidenced by angiography in 59% of the samples.__12____ __A connection between CAM and adipose tissue vessels was evidenced by immunohistochemistry, with recruitment of both avian and human endothelial cells.__13____ __The angiogenic potency of adipose tissue was not related to its localization (with an angiogenic stimulation in 60% of SAT samples and 61% of VAT samples)__14____ __or to adipocyte size or inflammatory infiltrate assessed in adipose samples before the graft on CAM.__15____ __Stimulation of angiogenesis by adipose tissue was nearly abolished by bevacizumab, which specifically targets human VEGF.__16____ __CONCLUSIONS: We have established a model to study the regulation of angiogenesis by human adipose tissue.__17____ __This model highlighted the role of VEGF in angiogenesis in both SAT and VAT.

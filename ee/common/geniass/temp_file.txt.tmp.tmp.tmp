Homeobox genes in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. 
Homeobox genes have a strikingly conserved 61-amino acid sequence, encoding DNA-binding domain.__0____ __Some homeobox genes, located in four clusters are designated HOX A through D, while others are known as divergent homeobox genes.__1____ __Many researchers have demonstrated that hematopoietic cells express many homeobox genes.__2____ __Induced over- and under-expression of these genes has been used to demonstrate their affect on some aspects of hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis.__3____ __Recently, knock-out mice of homeobox genes by targeted disruption have also been used to examine their hematological effect.__4____ __There are examples of the aberrant expression of a homeobox gene causing leukemias in humans.__5____ __In pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)__6____ __with t(1;19)__7____ __translocation, a fusion protein is created between E2A and a homeobox gene PBX.__8____ __In T-cell ALL with t(10;14)__9____ __translocation, the HOX 11 gene is deregulated.__10____ __In acute myeloid leukemia (AML)__11____ __with t(7;11)__12____ __translocation, the HOX A9 gene is rearranged.__13____ __In this review article, many functions of homeobox genes both at the early stem cell level as well as at the later stages of hematopoietic differentiation, and the leukemogenic effect of altered homeobox genes are discussed.

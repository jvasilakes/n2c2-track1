`run_medspacy_ner.py` has two models available: "transformer" and "vector".

`run_medspacy_quickumls.py`: The QuickUMLS module in medspacy isn't functioning properly. It doesn't find any entities
in the entire dev set. The example sentence given in
`https://github.com/medspacy/medspacy/blob/master/notebooks/11-QuickUMLS_Extraction.ipynb` works though.
